PERFIT DRAPE PROCESS DOCUMENTATION

1. MEASUREMENT CHECK
1.1 Goal
	The goal of measurement is to give a quick check whether the body model fits the chosen cloth in the aspect of size.

1.2 Input
	The body model(obj file) with the person's actual height in physics world.
	The cloth model(obj file) [need to extend by cloth team]

	./BodySimulation <body filename> <cloth filename>

1.3 Concepts & Process Description
	The basic concept is based on 
		Hyunsook Han, Yunja Nam, "Automatic body landmark identification for various body figures", Nov 2011,International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics
			https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251529928_Automatic_body_landmark_identification_for_various_body_figures
	
	(1) By iterating through all the nodes in the body, we can get the height of this model. Furthur more, get its ratio toward model's true height.
	(2) We slice the model in two directions, y direction which is the upward direction and x direction which is the left-to-right direction based the screen. 
		In both directions, we slice the model into 100 pieces.
	(3) Then we get the body direction in case of the model is not facing toward the users (z positive direction). The detail process is
		[1] get the piece in y direction where ankle is.
		[2] get the mean point in that piece, and assign and rotate a line[1] cross that point which full seperate both of the left part and right part.
			we make the assumption that if any points in that piece has the distance to the line larger than 5, we assume that the line is found.
		[3] find the mean points of both of left ankle and right ankle, draw a line[2] through these two point which is the direction of x axis.
		[4] find the furthurest two points in z direction in the lowest piece of the model. Calculate the distances of these two point to the line[2].
			The vertical line of the point with longer distance to line[2] is the direction of z directions.
	(4) Rotate the model into the correct direction
	(5) Find Crotch point
			Based on the paper, we define the range of the crotch point is with 45-55 sections in X direction. And find the highest point among each lowest
			points in these sections.
	(6) Find Armpits point
			Based on the paper, we define the range of the armpits are within 65-70 sections in Y direction and 20-40 sections for left armpit and 60-80 sections for right armpit.
			After having the intersections of two direction sections, find the highest point among each lowest poiint in intersections.
	(7) Find Waist
			Based on the paper, we define the range of the waist is within 45-60 sections in Y directions and 20-80 sections in X directions.
			We consider the waist as a ecllipse and find the furthurest left-to-right points and front-to-back points as a and b for the ecllipse.
			Using PI * (3ab-sqrt((3a+b)*(a+3b))) as the circumference.
	(8) Find Shoulder point
			Based on the paper, we define the range of the shoulder points are within 79-82 sections in Y direction. Find the furthurest two points in X direction
	(9) Find Hip point
			Based on the paper, we define the range of the hips are within 40-48 sections in Y directions. Find the furthurest points in Z directions.
	(10)Find Chest
			Based on the paper, we define the range of the chestare within 65-70 sections in Y directions. Calculate the chest like waist.
